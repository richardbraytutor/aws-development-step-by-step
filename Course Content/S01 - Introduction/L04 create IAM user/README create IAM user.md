# sign in as root user

assuming your root user email address is 

    awsstepbystep-xxx@gmail.com

the root signin page can currently be found this way

- go to https://signin.aws.amazon.com/
- select "sign in to console" at the top
- select the "sign in using root user email" button bottom left

If this doesn't work then just google "aws sign in" and follow the most obvious link !

login using your root email address / password

# setup MFA if you haven't already done so

- click on the username (awsstepbystep-xxx) at the top right
- select security credentials
- select Assign MFA device

i suggest you do this TWICE : 

- once with a passkey 
- once with an authenticator app on your phone

If you are unable to login then AWS support are contactable but it takes time ... so best have multiple options for getting in !

# IAM setup

## go to management console

depending on the exact login you may or may not be taken to the management console

if you are not at "Console Home" then 

- if you see "hello awsstepbystep-xxx" at the top right then click on that and select management console
- if there is an AWS "smile" icon in the top left then click on that

## go to the IAM service dashboard

- in the search bar at the top choose IAM (**not** IAM identity center)

if you are not on the IAM dashboard page then 

- select Dashboard in the left panel

## Set an account alias

this will help with logging in later 

- in the AWS account panel select "edit alias" and enter an alias name - something easy to remember later, eg "awsstepbystep-xxx"

## Create a user group

- click on User groups in the left panel
- press Create group button
- group name = admins
- attach permission policies = SELECT AdministratorAccess 
- create user group

WARNING

Members of this group are all powerful.  They can create billable resources.  

**All User accounts must have safely protected credentials**

e.g. Multi Factor Authentication.  

A user gaining access to your account is like someone gaining access to your mobile phone or email : take security seriously here !

## Create a user

- select Users in the left panel
- press Create user button
- user name = dev 
- [x] Provide user access to the AWS management console = true
- (o) autogenerated password (recommended)

- User groups [x] admins - add the user to the admins group
- press next
- press "create user" button
- Retrieve password - retrieve the autogenerated password from the "console password" selection 
- press return to users list
