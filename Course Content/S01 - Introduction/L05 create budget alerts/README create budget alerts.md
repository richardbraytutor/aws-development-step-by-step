Please note that BUDGETS DO NOT LIMIT YOUR EXPENDITURE

Budgets are ALERTS - they will notify you when you have spent - or are forecast to spend - more than your budgeted amount.

## create a zero-spend budget 
- (o) template = true
- (o) Zero spend budget = true
- email addresses : add your personal email address here 
- create budget

## create a montly one dollar budget (will handle actual or forecast)
- (o) template = true
- (o) Monthly cost budget = true
- Name = My 1 DOLLAR Monthly Cost Budget
- amount = 1.00
- email addresses : add your personal email address here 
- create budget

## repeat for $5, $10, $25, $50, $100

there is no harm in creating numerous budgets !

The course is designed to avoid you being charged AWS costs - however these budgets are put in place to mitigate against 
- accidentally created costs
- changes in AWS charging structure
